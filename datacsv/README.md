I had a test somewhere getting this file from DATABLIST:

https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/datablist/sample-csv-files/main/files/people/people-100.csv

It has moved here, recently in their new repo:

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1phaHg9objxK2MwaZmSUZAKQ8kVqlgng4&export=download

I really do not want to wait for a new movement and then fix my test, so I will try to copy the test here.
Since I will not remove it (unless github makes me do it) and I think the file is small enough to be ok.

Thanks in advance to datablist. They generated those fake records (according to their readme) so I don't need
to do it.

Their new repo: https://github.com/datablist/sample-csv-files

Cheers!
