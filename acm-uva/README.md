# acm-uva

My attempts for ACM UVA problems.


## History

I've collected my previous attempt from [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/zorionk/prog/acm/problems/)


## Python3 at ACM!

On 2017-10-08 I discovered that Python3 is also accepted in [ACM-UVA judge online](https://uva.onlinejudge.org)
so I will try using it instead of C++.
