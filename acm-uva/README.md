# acm-uva

My attempts for ACM UVA problems.


## History

I've collected my previous attempt from [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/zorionk/prog/acm/problems/)


## Python3 at ACM!

On 2017-10-08 I discovered that Python3 is also accepted in [ACM-UVA judge online](https://uva.onlinejudge.org)
so I will try using it instead of C++.


## Disclaimer:

I keep those attempts to solve the different problems on my own.

You are welcome to have a look, make a suggestion, pull request or comment but I suggest you to try for yourself first.

Although your are welcome to collaborate here, take into account that if you want to keep your own track you may start your own repository.

Enjoy coding!
