# TRACKING PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS

I keep this repo for keeping my own track solving problems.
I lost track in the past and I would like to start again.


## Disclaimer:

I keep those attempts to solve the different problems on my own.

You are welcome to have a look, make a suggestion, pull request or comment but I suggest you to try for yourself first.

Although your are welcome to collaborate here, take into account that if you want to keep your own track you may start your own repository.

Enjoy coding!
